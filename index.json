However, it remains unclear precisely what knowledge the LM manages to capture during pre-training and how word frequency in the training corpus affects the acquisition of knowledge about these words.\nAs part of the final project of NLP course I explored the correlation between word occurrence in the language and general world knowledge acquired by a Language Model during pre-training. In my work I propose a framework for testing this subject, using a downstream \u0026ldquo;Yes/No\u0026rdquo; QA task. My findings show positive correlations between: (a) word occurrence and the accuracy of answers for this word. (b) co-occurrence of two words and a tendency of the model to answer \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; for questions about their relation.\nFurther details can be found in my github and paper.\n","date":1613951848,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613951848,"objectID":"60303039c0525200be1e7aa638673c37","permalink":"https://eliavmor-tau.github.io/project/do-language-models-understand-frequent-words-better/","publishdate":"2021-02-21T23:57:28.129Z","relpermalink":"/project/do-language-models-understand-frequent-words-better/","section":"project","summary":"Pre-trained language models (LMs) have recently demonstrated outstanding results across a variety of tasks.
