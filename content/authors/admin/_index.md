My name is Eliav Mor and I'm an M.Sc Computer Science student at Tel Aviv university and an Algorithm Engineer at Samsung Research Israel Center. 

I enjoy expanding my knowledge in computer science, coding, and solving theoretical problems. I am passionate aboutÂ  problem solving, algorithms, and out-of-the-box thinking. In my free time I like hiking, running, and making pottery.

My main field of interest are explainability, robustness, compatibility and pre-training in machine learning and deep learning in specific.
