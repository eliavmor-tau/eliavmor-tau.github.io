The final project of the course AMNLP (Advanced methods in NLP), together with [Shimon Malnick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shimon-malnick-1b8404125/), we tried to solve the CR resolution task on the OntoNotes benchmark by fine-tuning BART and T5. Our best model achieved an average F1 score of 36.8% on CoNLL, while limiting the input length (due to resource constraints). Our code is publicly available in our github [repository](https://github.com/ShimonMalnick/Generative-Coreference-Resolution).
