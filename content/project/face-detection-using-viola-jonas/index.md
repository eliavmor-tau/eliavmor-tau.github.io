As part of of my passion to CV algorithms, I challenged myself to implement a real-time algorithm for face detection fromÂ *scratch*.

The Viola Jones is a very light-weight FD algorithm that combines a set of weak (and fast) classifiers into a single strong classifier using boosting.

More details, demo and code are available in my [GitHub](https://github.com/eliavmor-tau/ViolaJonesFD/blob/main/README.md) repository.
